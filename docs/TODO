Community system:
- Central database on urdland.com that keeps track of 'stuff', initially for say 1 week, if np we could increase to several weeks (not much point in much longer than that)
- 'stuff':
	:Update: -> Set was valid, this changes name, description, rating, archive password, whatnot
	:Delete: -> Set was invalid (ie 10 sets for 1 actual download, say a cd where all tracks are seperate sets)
	:Add: -> Set was invalid (ie 1 set for 2 downloads, say two episodes that are merged into 1 set), this would be 1 :Delete: and 2 :Add:'s
	:Comment: -> Comments for sets
or..
	:Merge:
	:Split: ?
	Problem is that the client needs to know which articles to put in the set... just an Add won't be enough, and we don't want to store all
	articles too, way too much data.

- When URD updates a newsgroup, after completing it will check the central database and download additional info for the newsgroup (within the expire period)
- The user will see the 'beautified' info, such as:

[5156]-[#a.b.hdtv.x264@EFNet]-[Persepolis.720p.BluRay.x264-BoNE]-[000/104] "bone-pp.nzb" 
becomes:
Persepolis [2007] [imdblink] 720p DTS
Content score: 8.1
Quality: excellent

The user can click some button to see other 'versions', like the first 2 alternatives

Central database: 
table Sets (setid bigint auto_increment, setname, type (update/delete/add), 
- x, 'Big Buck Bunny', ':Update:'
- a, 'Random File', ':Delete:'

table Tags (setid bigint auto_increment, tagname, tagvalue userid)
- x, 'format', '720p', 'cruz'
- y, 'quality', 'bad', 'cruz'
- z, 'imdblink', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808417/', 'cruz'
- a, 'comment', 'has virus!1111', 'piet'
