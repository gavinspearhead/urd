Updating an existing URD version to a newer version is basically pretty simple. 
It will retain all database values, so all your subscriptions to newsgroups 
and all are still there after the upgrade. Upgrading is pretty simple really:

Step 0: 
Stop the URD daemon by clicking the "URDD is online" button.

Step 1:
Extract the new tarball to the directory where URD is installed. In case of a
.deb packages, this will work automatically.

Step 2:
URD now has an update script in the sub directory install/. Chdir to the 
install directory and you can run it as:
./update.sh 

And it will try to find out the currently configured version and the updated 
version. Or run it with the currently configured version if it fails; as 
./update.sh x.y.z
(where x.y.z is the current version)

If you got the deb package this should be done automatically as well. If it 
gives an error try to run the update script anyway.

If all this fails somehow, you can manually update the database as pointed out
in step 2A. 

Step 2A: (try only if the step 2 failed!)
Update the database. This depends a bit on the database you use. For MySQL 
something like:

# mysql -u db_user db_password urddb < update_x.y.z_to_a.b.c_mysql.sql

will do the trick. You have to fill in the correct values for db_user 
(often root), db_password and urddb (which is the default database name). For 
postgres you need the file  update_x.y.z_to_a.b.c_pgsql.sql. And run the psql command.

Here x.y.z is the installed version and a.b.c is the version you wish to 
upgrade to. database scripts are only provided from one version to 
the next. If you need to upgrade more versions you have to run all the 
applicable update scripts.


Step 3:
In very rare cases, you may have to update the config.php. 

Step 4:
Restart the URD daemon by clicking the "URDD is offline" button.

Step 5:
That is all there is. There is no step 5. Happy URD'ing again with your brand 
new version :D


If anything goes wrong have a look at the log file (admin/log in the menu, or 
/tmp/urdd.log) to see what is wrong.
