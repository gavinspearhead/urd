Description: Web based binary download
 URD is a program to download binaries from usenet (newsgroups) via a web based interface. It's written entirely in PHP, besides making use of a few external programs to do some of the CPU intensive work. It stores all the information it needs in a generic database (like MySQL, or PostGreSQL). Articles are aggregated into sets of files that belong together. Downloading requires only a few clicks. Optionally, an NZB file can be created. When the download is finished it can automatically verify the par2 or sfv files and decompress the results. In the background URD uses a download program called URDD or the URD Daemon. This daemon handles nearly all of the activity with respect to the newsgroups, the sets and the downloads.
